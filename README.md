# Bugbear's Scripts

## Description
A small module for Foundry and Dnd5e which contains scripts that thislonelybugbear finds useful.

The ones included can at any point be altered, based on functionality absorbed/fixed/removed from relevant modules or the system.

The initial commit hooks on preCreateActiveEffect and preUpdateActiveEffect, in order to add the proper MidiQOL flags to the system's core status effects, resolving the current issue with DFreds CE not being compatible with dnd5e v3.x.
- Set the Replace core status effects setting in DFreds CE, to NONE.
