# Bugbear's Scripts

## Description
A small module for Foundry and Dnd5e which uses contains some scripts that this lonely bugbear finds useful.

The ones included can at any point be removed, based on functionality absorbed/fixed/removed from relevant modules or the system.

The initial commit puts the MidiQOL flags back to system's core status effects, resolving the current issue with DFreds CE not being compatible with dnd5e v3.x.
- Set the Replace core status effects setting in DFreds CE, to NONE.
